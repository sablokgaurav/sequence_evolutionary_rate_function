# sequence_evolutionary_rate_function
applying sequence evolutionary function to multitude of files estimating it across the sites and the branch models and estimating the lineage evolutionary pressure. This implements the paml model of sequence evolution across all the fasta sequences and analyzes the site site specific and the branch site models for the evolutionary framework.
